# langchain-openai-assistant
A terminal-based AI assistant built with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.   This project uses a **ReAct agent** (Reason + Act) that can process natural language queries and stream responses in real time.   It’s easy to extend with additional tools for calculations, API calls, or other custom capabilities.
